# Purpose: 
The goal of this project is to develop a spatial analytics tool that leverages geospatial data to help retail businesses identify optimal locations for new stores, ultimately maximizing revenue. This tool evaluates key metrics, including: <br> 
 -> Population Density: Ensuring a high volume of potential customers. <br> 
 -> Median Income: Targeting areas with stronger purchasing power. <br>
 -> Competitor Proximity: Avoiding regions with high market saturation. <br>
 -> Traffic Patterns: Identifying locations with increased visibility and foot traffic. <br>
## Tech Stack: <br>
 -> Back End: Flask (Python) for data processing and API endpoints <br>
 -> Front End: HTML/JavaScript with the ArcGIS API for interactive maps

 ## System Architecture:
 Our application follows a two-tier approach. The back end, built with Flask, handles data ingestion, processing, and serves APi endpoints while the front end, built with HTML and JavaScript using the ArcGIS API, displays an interactive map that fetches and visualizes this data. 

 ## API Endpoints:
